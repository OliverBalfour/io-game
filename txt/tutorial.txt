[Tutorial]

Welcome to [name].io

This game is played on a large grid with other players

You move troops around and battle to conquer other players

To move troops, first click on one of your tiles

Now, you may move troops in any direction with the following keys

Q, W, E, A, S, D (show which directions they go in)

When you move troops onto an adjacent empty tile, you capture it

Then, you can see all of the surrounding tiles

There is another player on the map

See if you can find them and conquer their castle

When a player has no castles left, they lose and the player who beat them gets all of their land

There are different kinds of tiles

You can't pass mountains

Castles, forts and barracks generate troops at different rates, and give you money

Farms give you money, with which you buy buildings

Let's build a farm on one of our tiles

Perfect! You're ready to go!
