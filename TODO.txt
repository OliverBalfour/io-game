-= Suggestions =-

 - 'The gods are angry' - When a game goes for too long, make tiles turn into 'the void' around the outside
    - Maybe also make all mountains 'volcanos' which randomly erupt every ~50 turns killing surrounding troops
 - Generate mountain ranges, allowing for strategy to be a lot better
 - Add right click + drag to quickly and easily make movement chains
 - Supply lines/battle fronts by setting up automatic queuing
 - Heatmap view to show troop concentration
 - Add rivers/streams
 - Add music
 - Make mountain placement better, and either:
    - Ensure maps are fair; no players cut off by mountains from the rest of the map, or
    - Make some way of crossing mountains
 - Make colour picking for players or something with ['orangered', 'orange', 'royalblue', 'yellow', 'limegreen', 'indigo', 'greenyellow', 'gold', 'darkblue', 'teal']
 - Build AIs to sneak into games when no one else is playing
 - Add in building times for each building, in which they are inactive (being built)
 - Add several game modes, 8v8, 1v1, 2v2 teams, hex with a player in each corner, singleplayer against AI, hot seat, diplomacy w/ 6 players
 - Add in 'fallen civilisations,' which have money and castles and a little land
 - Replays
 - End of game graphs
